    <p>
      Freelancer for four years, I'm a Ruby and Python full stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>I dedicated myself to various engaging projects, including my own startup (Cohome) and adult trainings.</p>
    <p>I created a Bachelor French training for OpenClassrooms: <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/68-developpeur-se-dapplication-python" target="_blank" data-type="link">Python developer</a>!</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like laughing and hiking!</p>
