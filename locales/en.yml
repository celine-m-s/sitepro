  whoIAmText: "I am a painter and its palette! Like him, I like to create, to design new shapes and to make precious objects out of my imagination. My colors range from communication to code, from search engine optimization to photographs. I spend my time developing, indeed, but also smiling, listening, pushing projects and looking around!"
  iAmCreative: "I am <strong>Creative</strong>"
  iAmCreative1: "All my activites have creation in common. I am a photograph amateur, I directed short-movies and I create websites all day long! <br><p>And, to further feed the cliché, I work on a Mac, with a graphic tablet and a lot of hard-drives located all over the planet.</p>"
  iAmCreative2: "Creativity is above all a medium to find the best solution at a given time to a given problem.<p>I created the Web-Design Express, with friends, in the same spirit: providing learners with any tool they need to create their own website. Every problem has its solution!</p>"
  iAmStructured: "I am <strong>Structured</strong>"
  iAmStructured1: "As a freelance, being rigorous is a necessity. We have several projects to manage at the same time, many interlocutors and very diverse questions. I always had many activities, even when I was an employee. Why? Because I strongly like diversity and I need to learn new things everyday. And also because I like seing through projects, happy ends and happy customers!"
  iAmStructured2: "I graduated from a Management School and I got involved in many projects since I was a child (I was 13 when I shot a movie for the first time). At school, I was part of several projects aiming to change the world. These experiences taught me how organization and management are fundamentals to succeed in a project."
  iAmStructured3: "<em><strong>[Celine] is a very organized and driven person who works very well both in the team and autonomously.</strong> Celine is not reluctant to voice her opinion and always looks for the best route to make the projects effective and efficient. <br>It is without reluctance that I recommend her as an excellent addition to anyone's team in the EU or Internationally<br></em>."
  iAmListening: "I am <strong>Listening</strong"
  iAmListening1: I use the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89coute_active" target="_blank">active listening method</a> everyday to please my clients and my collaborators. In fact I strongly believe that <strong>any problem has its own solution</strong>. No solution no problem! So I will find the best way to bring a quick and relevant answer to my interlocutor request. 
  iAmListening2: "I continually train myself to be able to solve those problems with efficiency. The skills I develop everyday are : search engine optimization, web-development, web-design, project management techniques, technological watch, ... This lets me bring the best of myself to projects. And always with a smile on my face!"
  iAmListening3: "<em>Celine is a dynamic collaborator, strong-willed and self-started who gives all her professional (and personal) skills to its enterprise. (...) Really proactive, naturally positive and enthusiastic, Celine likes to push her limits, to learn everyday and to let her collaborators benefit from it.</em>"

I made a 2-year intensive course in Humanities in the south of France, then a Management Scool (Audencia, in Nantes) and my first profesionnal experiences were in digital communication, marketing and online training (e-learning). <br>I learned how to code years ago for two reasons: being more relevant at work and knowing a new creation medium. I loved it so much that I am coding everyday now! "
